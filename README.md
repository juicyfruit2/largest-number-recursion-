# largest-number-recursion-
- In a file called largest_number.py, create:
- A function that returns the largest number in a list of integers taken
as an argument.
- This needs to be solved recursively without using loops.
- Examples of input and output:
- largest_number([1, 4, 5, 3])
=> 5
- largest_number([3, 1, 6, 8, 2, 4, 5])
=> 8
